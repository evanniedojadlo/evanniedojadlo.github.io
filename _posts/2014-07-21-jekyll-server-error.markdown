When I attempt to run the Jekyll local server I am returning the error:
  
  Liquid Exception: Included file '_includes/JB/setup' not found in _posts/2014-07-21-test-post-with-rake.md/#excerpt

 My guess is that this is due to my attempt at generating a post via the rake command. I will be going over it today in class and reporting on the fix.
