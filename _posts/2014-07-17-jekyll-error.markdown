When attempting to run my Jekyll build on my local machine using jekyll --server I returned the following error:

 Deprecation: Jekyll now uses subcommands instead of just switches. Run `jekyll --help' to find out more.
 Deprecation: The --server command has been replaced by the 'serve' subcommand.

This is where I learned that "deprecation" refers to a command or piece of code that is no longer in use.
