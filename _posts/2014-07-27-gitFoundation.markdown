I am running into an issue where I create a new foundation project within a directory that already has an existing git repo. The new foundation project seems to be automatically generating a .git file on creation.

As a tempotary solution I am just going to create a new repo on github and not create a repo inside of an existing directory already containing one.

UPDATE:
Creating a stand alone directory resolved the previous issue of the project being inaccessible on github.
