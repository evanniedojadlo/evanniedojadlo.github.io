I decided on using GitHub issues over both Atlassian JIRA and Pivotal Tracker for maintaining bugs in the MangaBytes web app. I figured that GitHub Issues works for this project because MangaBytes is open source and if anyone wants to contribute they can have at it.

For feature requests and future changes I will continue using my personal Google docs for the project roadmap until I find something better which includes easy collaboration.
