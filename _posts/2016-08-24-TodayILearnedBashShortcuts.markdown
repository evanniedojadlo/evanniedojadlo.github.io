TIL:

All of the Keyboard shortcuts for shell that I have been missing out on:

	Ctrl + A	Go to the beginning of the line you are currently typing on
	Ctrl + E	Go to the end of the line you are currently typing on
	Ctrl + L              	Clears the Screen, similar to the clear command
	Ctrl + U	Clears the line before the cursor position. If you are at the end of the line, clears the entire line.
	Ctrl + H	Same as backspace
	Ctrl + R	Let’s you search through previously used commands
	Ctrl + C	Kill whatever you are running
	Ctrl + D	Exit the current shell
	Ctrl + Z	Puts whatever you are running into a suspended background process. fg restores it.
	Ctrl + W	Delete the word before the cursor
	Ctrl + K	Clear the line after the cursor
	Ctrl + T	Swap the last two characters before the cursor
	Esc + T	Swap the last two words before the cursor
	Alt + F	Move cursor forward one word on the current line
	Alt + B	Move cursor backward one word on the current line
	Tab	Auto-complete files and folder names
